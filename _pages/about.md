Dr. Rohitash Chandra is UniSyd Fellow at the Centre for Translational Data Science and School of Geosciences at the University of Sydney. His research interests are in areas of deep learning, neuro-evolution, Bayesian methods, solid Earth Evolution, reef modelling and mineral exploration. Currently he is developing novel learning algorithms for robust and dynamic decision making given misinformation and uncertainty from the environment. This provides a synergy of deep learning methods with Bayesian inference, and multi-task  learning.  Currently, he is involved in projects that employ machine learning methods and Bayesian inference via  parallel tempering for solid Earth evolution, mineral exploration, and reef modelling.   

**Current Research Projects**

**Bayesian deep learning for uncertain environments:**   We develop novel learning algorithms for robust decision making given misinformation and uncertainty from the environment. This provides a synergy of neural networks with modular, multi-task and transfer learning.  We employ   Bayesian methods to address uncertainty quantification in emerging deep learning methods. 
Collaborators: Prof. Sally Cripps, Centre for Translational Data Science; Prof. Junbin Gao, USyd Business School.

**Solid Earth evolution:** The solid Earth evolution project considers Bayesian inference and machine learning for landscape dynamics model (BayesLands). 
Collaborators: Prof. Dietmar Muller and Dr. Tristan Salles, School of Geosciences; Prof. Sally Cripps, Centre for Translational Data Science.

**Reef modelling:** We provide uncertainty quantification estimation of free parameters using Bayesian inference for reef modelling (BayesReef). The objectives is  to gain 
insights into the flux of carbon by analysing carbonate platform growth and 
demise through time, and modelling their evolution using  lanscape dynamics and 
reef modelling Python packages  (Badlands  and pyRee). Bayesian  and machine 
learning methods will be used  in conjunction with landscape and reef models to 
predict the future evolution of landscape and reef systems around the world and 
their impact on the carbon cycle.

Collaborators: A/Prof. Jody Webster and Dr. Tristan Salles, School of Geosciences; Prof. Sally Cripps, Centre for Translational Data Science.

**Mineral exploration:**  We provide a synergy of machine learning, geo-physical forward models, and Bayesian inference for the robust location of sites for mineral prospecting and exploration. 
Collaborators: Prof. Chris Clark, Dr. Hugo Olierook (Curtin University); Prof. Sally Cripps, Centre for Translational Data Science;   Prof. Dietmar Muller, School of Geosciences


**Paleo-climate:** The objective is to develop models that can describe the climate of the past that range for millions of years. Collaborators: Prof. Dietmar Muller, School of Geosciences; Prof. Sally Cripps, Centre for Translational Data Science.

**Machine consciousness:** Develop computational models of machine consciousness that simulate aspects such as personality, affection, and reasoning.

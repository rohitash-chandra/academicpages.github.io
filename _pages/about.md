My research interests are in areas of deep learning, recurrent neural networks, neuroevolution, time series analysis, and Bayesian methods. I am developing novel learning algorithms for robust and dynamic decision making given misinformation and uncertainty from the environment. This provides a synergy of deep learning methods with Bayesian inference, multi-task and transfer learning. Applications include climate extremes, solid Earth, and geo-coastal modelling. Moreover, I am interested in developing learning algorithms to simulate aspects of consciousness that include personality and attention.

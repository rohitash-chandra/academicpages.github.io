My research interests are in areas of deep learning, recurrent neural networks, neuroevolution, time series analysis, and Bayesian methods. I am developing novel learning algorithms for robust and dynamic decision making given misinformation and uncertainty from the environment. This provides a synergy of deep learning methods with Bayesian inference, multi-task and transfer learning. Applications include climate extremes, solid Earth, and geo-coastal modelling. Moreover, I am interested in developing learning algorithms to simulate aspects of consciousness that include personality and attention.

**Current Research Projects**

** **Neural networks in uncertain environment:** Develop novel learning algo- rithms for robust decision making given misinformation and uncertainty from the environment. This provides a synergy of neural networks with modular, multi-task and transfer learning. Applications in dynamic and uncertain envi- ronments that includes time series and pattern classification.

** **Bayesian deep learning with Prof. Sally Cripps:** Employ synergy of Bayesian inference with Markov Chain Monti Carlo (MCMC) methods to address uncertainty quantification in deep learning.

** **Solid Earth and geo-coastal (reef) modelling with Prof. Dietmar Muller, A/Prof. Jody Webster and Dr. Tristan Salles (School of Geosciences, The University of Sydney):** The objectives is to gain insights into the flux of carbon by analysing carbonate platform growth and demise through time, and modelling their evolution using lanscape dynamics and reef modelling Python packages (Badlands 2 and Pyreef 3). Bayesian optimisation and machine learning meth- ods will be used in conjunction with landscape and reef models to predict the future evolution of landscape and reef systems around the world and their impact on the carbon cycle 4.

**2018 Project ideas**

**Bayesian inference via MCMC and Evolutionary Algorithms**

* Improve MCMC via  Cooperative Coevolution (CC) (Use G3-PCX CC and give a MCMC framework for constrained real parameter optimisation and inference)

* MCMC with Parallel (Multi-threaded in C++) CC for Expensive Parameter Optimisation 

**Computer Vision via Deep Learning**

* Face Recoginition for Authentication  via Multi-task learning (Use Videos and Sound)

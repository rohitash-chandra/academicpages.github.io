=================

**Bayesian inference via MCMC and Evolutionary Algorithms**

* Improve MCMC via  Cooperative Coevolution (CC) (Use G3-PCX CC and give a MCMC framework for constrained real parameter optimisation and inference)

* MCMC with Parallel (Multi-threaded in C++) CC for Expensive Parameter Optimisation 

**Computer Vision via Deep Learning**

* Face Recoginition for Authentication  via Multi-task learning (Use Videos and Sound)

**Bayesian Deep Learning**

* Robust Bayesian Neural Networks for Dynamic Time Series Prediction
* Autonoumous feature ranking and learning for modular pattern classifiation via Bayesian Neural Networks



**Applications**

* Cyclone Track Prediction
* Reef Modelling
* Solid Earth Evolution
* Mineral Exploration
